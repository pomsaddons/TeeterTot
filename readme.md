# The only open source Harris Teeter coupon grabber
Grocery stores love being annoying about discounts that should be automatically in the checkout lane. This script automatically fetches 200 coupons for you randomly. There is not a category sort yet, but I plan to implement it in the future. 
# Instructions
Press Ctrl+Shift+I on your web browser, on the Harris Teeter website. Head over to console, and copy TeeterTot.js. Next, paste it into the field, and run it. It will proceed grabbing, and clipping coupons for you.

If you paid for this, you got scammed.
